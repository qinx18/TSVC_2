# Vectorizer_3s Failure and Poor Performance Analysis

## Summary Statistics

- Total functions: 48
- Failed functions: 8 (16.7%)
- Functions with poor performance (<2x speedup): 22 (45.8%)

## Failed Functions Analysis

### 1. s1113 - Broadcast with self-overwrite dependency

**Error Type**: Correctness (all 3 attempts)
**Pattern**: `a[i] = a[LEN_1D/2] + b[i]`
**Issue**: The vectorized code failed to handle the case where `a[LEN_1D/2]` gets overwritten during iteration `i=LEN_1D/2`, causing subsequent iterations to use the wrong value.
**Checksum Difference**: 6.40e+09 (doubled value - suggests all elements used the updated value instead of original)
**Analysis**: The prompt correctly identified the need to save the original value, but the implementation still used it throughout all iterations instead of switching to the updated value after `i >= LEN_1D/2`.

### 2. s1213 - Sum with multiplication

**Error Type**: Correctness
**Pattern**: Complex sum pattern with multiplication
**Issue**: Incorrect handling of accumulation pattern

### 3. s2111 - Conditional with dependency

**Error Type**: Mixed (correctness and infinite loop)
**Pattern**: Conditional assignment with complex dependencies
**Issue**: The vectorization created infinite loops or incorrect results

### 4. s242 - Sequential dependency with accumulation

**Error Type**: Correctness
**Pattern**: `a[i] = a[i - 1] + s * b[i] + c[i]`
**Issue**: Strong sequential dependency that's hard to vectorize correctly

### 5. s244 - Multiple dependencies

**Error Type**: Correctness
**Pattern**:

```c
a[i] = b[i] + c[i] * d[i];
b[i] = c[i] + b[i];
a[i+1] = b[i] + a[i+1] * d[i];
```

**Issue**: Complex inter-statement dependencies where `b[i]` is updated and immediately used in `a[i+1]`
**Checksum Difference**: Small (0.03125) - suggests subtle error in handling overlapping array accesses

### 6. s318 - Maximum with index tracking

**Error Type**: Correctness
**Pattern**: Finding maximum element and its index
**Issue**: Index tracking in vectorized code is challenging

### 7. s332 - Reverse order processing

**Error Type**: Correctness
**Pattern**: Loop runs backwards (`i = LEN_1D - 2; i >= 0; i--`)
**Issue**: Reverse order dependencies are hard to vectorize

### 8. s343 - Packed array operations

**Error Type**: Correctness/Compilation
**Pattern**: Operations on packed 2D arrays
**Issue**: Complex memory access patterns

## Poor Performance Functions (<2x speedup)

### Severely Poor Performance (<1x - slower than scalar)

1. **s342 (0.48x)**: Conditional compaction with sequential index tracking
2. **s141 (0.55x)**: Complex packed array operations
3. **s277 (0.57x)**: Conditional assignments with complex control flow
4. **s2251 (0.63x)**: Search operations (first/last occurrence)
5. **s116 (0.71x)**: Sequential dependencies within groups

### Key Patterns in Poor Performance

1. **Sequential Dependencies**: Functions with strong data dependencies between iterations
2. **Conditional Operations**: Heavy use of if-statements that create divergent control flow
3. **Index Tracking**: Operations that maintain running indices (like s342's `j++`)
4. **Complex Memory Access**: Non-contiguous or strided memory patterns
5. **Search Operations**: Finding specific elements or patterns

### Specific Example - s342 Performance Analysis

The s342 function shows why some patterns hurt performance when vectorized:
- **Pattern**: Conditional compaction (`if (a[i] > 0) { j++; a[i] = b[j]; }`)
- **Vectorization Overhead**: The code loads/stores arrays for mask computation and element-wise processing
- **Sequential Nature**: The `j++` operation must be done sequentially, negating SIMD benefits
- **Result**: 2x slower than scalar code despite correct results

## Root Causes of Failures

### 1. Inadequate Dependency Analysis

The prompt asks for dependency analysis but doesn't provide specific guidance for:
- Self-modifying loops (like s1113)
- Cross-iteration dependencies (like s242)
- Complex multi-statement dependencies (like s244)

### 2. Oversimplified Vectorization Strategy

The prompt's 6-step process doesn't adequately address:
- Loops with sequential accumulation
- Conditional operations with side effects
- Index tracking and compaction operations

### 3. Missing Edge Case Handling

The prompts don't emphasize:
- Boundary conditions
- Special cases when indices overlap
- Proper handling of loop-carried dependencies

### 4. Insufficient Pattern Recognition

The system doesn't recognize anti-patterns that shouldn't be vectorized:
- Strong sequential dependencies
- Complex control flow
- Operations better suited for scalar processing

## Prompt Engineering Issues

### 1. Overly Optimistic Approach

The prompt assumes all loops can be vectorized effectively, leading to:
- Forced vectorization of inherently sequential code
- Complex workarounds that add overhead
- Missing recognition of when to avoid vectorization

### 2. Insufficient Context

The prompts lack:
- Performance cost-benefit analysis guidance
- Recognition of vectorization anti-patterns
- Fallback strategies for difficult cases

### 3. Generic Instructions

The 6-step analysis process is too generic for:
- Specialized patterns (reductions, scans, compaction)
- Complex dependency chains
- Mixed scalar-vector operations

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Enhanced Dependency Analysis**: Add specific prompts for detecting and handling different types of dependencies
2. **Pattern Classification**: Pre-classify loops into vectorizable vs. non-vectorizable categories
3. **Hybrid Approaches**: For partially vectorizable loops, use hybrid scalar-vector approaches
4. **Better Edge Case Handling**: Explicit prompts for boundary and special case analysis
5. **Performance Prediction**: Add heuristics to predict when vectorization might hurt performance
6. **Fallback Strategies**: When full vectorization fails, try partial vectorization or optimization without SIMD
7. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Include prompts to evaluate whether vectorization is worth the complexity
8. **Pattern-Specific Prompts**: Create specialized prompts for common patterns (reductions, scans, etc.)
