# Statistical Framework for LLM Vectorization Analysis

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive statistical framework for analyzing LLM vectorization performance with confidence intervals. The framework addresses the inherent non-determinism in LLM-based code generation by providing robust statistical measures of success rates and performance metrics.

## Problem Statement

LLM vectorization results exhibit variability across runs due to:
- **Temperature > 0** causing probabilistic output generation
- **Different vectorization strategies** for the same function
- **Varying code quality** and optimization choices
- **System-level performance noise**

Without statistical analysis, single-run results can be misleading and don't provide confidence bounds on the reported metrics.

## Framework Components

### 1. Statistical Analysis Framework (`statistical_analysis.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Wilson Score Confidence Intervals** for success rates (better for small samples)
- **t-distribution confidence intervals** for performance metrics
- **Coefficient of variation** analysis for stability assessment
- **Function categorization** based on statistical properties

**Core Statistics Calculated:**
```python
# Success Rate Analysis
success_rate = success_count / n_runs
ci_lower, ci_upper = wilson_score_interval(success_count, n_runs, confidence=0.95)

# Performance Analysis
mean_speedup = np.mean(speedups)
std_speedup = np.std(speedups, ddof=1)
t_value = stats.t.ppf(0.975, n - 1)
ci_lower = mean_speedup - t_value * std_speedup / sqrt(n)
ci_upper = mean_speedup + t_value * std_speedup / sqrt(n)
```

### 2. Multiple Experiment Runner (`run_multiple_experiments.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- **Automated multi-run execution** with different random seeds
- **Isolated experiment directories** for each run
- **Comprehensive logging** and error tracking
- **Results aggregation** and summary statistics

**Usage:**
```bash
python run_multiple_experiments.py --runs 10 --base-dir /path/to/experiments
```

### 3. Simulation Framework (`simulate_multiple_runs.py`)

**For demonstration purposes:**
- **Realistic variability modeling** based on function characteristics
- **Log-normal noise** for performance metrics (more realistic than Gaussian)
- **Function-specific stability profiles** (high performers vs. variable functions)
- **Checksum error simulation** (2% probability)

## Key Statistical Metrics

### Success Rate Analysis
- **Point Estimate**: Proportion of successful runs
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Wilson score method
- **Interpretation**: "We are 95% confident the true success rate lies within this interval"

### Performance Analysis
- **Mean Speedup**: Average performance improvement
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of variability
- **95% Confidence Interval**: t-distribution based
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Relative variability (std/mean)

### Stability Classification
- **Stable Functions**: CV < 0.2 (consistent performance)
- **Variable Functions**: CV > 0.5 (high variability)
- **High-Confidence Success**: Success rate CI > 80%

## Demonstrated Results

### Overall Performance Summary
- **Functions analyzed**: 50
- **Average success rate**: 100.0% ± 0.0%
- **Average speedup**: 3.39x ± 6.98x
- **Confidence level**: 95%

### Function-Level Examples

**High-Performance, Stable Function (s256):**
- **Success rate**: 100.0% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100.0%)
- **Average speedup**: 50.39x ± 4.65x
- **Speedup 95% CI**: 46.50x - 54.28x
- **Coefficient of variation**: 0.09 (very stable)

**Variable Performance Function (s342):**
- **Success rate**: 100.0% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100.0%)
- **Average speedup**: 0.86x ± 0.29x
- **Speedup 95% CI**: 0.62x - 1.11x
- **Coefficient of variation**: 0.34 (moderate variability)

**Compiler Interaction Example (s112):**
- **Original vectorized rate**: 100.0% (compiler already optimized)
- **LLM vectorized rate**: 0.0% (LLM broke compiler optimization)
- **Average speedup**: 0.87x ± 0.30x (minimal gain due to compiler competition)

### Statistical Categories

**Stable Functions (CV < 0.2)**: 42 functions
- These functions show consistent performance across runs
- Low variability makes them reliable for deployment

**Consistent High Performance**: 21 functions
- Functions with speedup CI > 2.0x
- Prime candidates for manual vectorization

**Variable Performance (CV > 0.5)**: 0 functions
- In this simulation, no functions showed extreme variability
- Real experiments might reveal functions requiring investigation

## Practical Applications

### 1. Experimental Design
```python
# Recommended minimum runs for statistical significance
n_runs = 10-20  # For each function
confidence_level = 0.95  # Standard confidence level
```

### 2. Decision Making
- **Deploy functions** with high-confidence success rates (CI > 80%)
- **Investigate functions** with high variability (CV > 0.5)
- **Prioritize functions** with consistent high performance (CI > 2.0x)

### 3. Performance Comparison
- **Before/after comparisons** with statistical significance testing
- **Confidence intervals** for comparing different approaches
- **Effect size** measurement beyond just statistical significance

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Run Multiple Experiments
```bash
# Create multiple experimental runs
python run_multiple_experiments.py --runs 10

# Or simulate for demonstration
python simulate_multiple_runs.py
```

### Step 2: Statistical Analysis
```bash
# Analyze results with confidence intervals
python statistical_analysis.py --pattern "experiment_run_*/results.json" --confidence 0.95
```

### Step 3: Interpret Results
- **Check confidence intervals** for overlap in comparisons
- **Assess coefficient of variation** for stability
- **Identify high-confidence functions** for deployment

## Advantages of Statistical Framework

### 1. **Quantified Uncertainty**
- Confidence intervals provide bounds on true performance
- Coefficient of variation measures relative stability
- Statistical significance testing for comparisons

### 2. **Robust Decision Making**
- Avoid decisions based on single-run outliers
- Identify truly stable vs. variable functions
- Quantify risk in deployment decisions

### 3. **Experimental Rigor**
- Reproducible methodology
- Standardized statistical measures
- Clear interpretation guidelines

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. **Sample Size Requirements**
- Minimum 5-10 runs for meaningful confidence intervals
- More runs needed for rare events or high precision
- Computational cost vs. statistical precision trade-off

### 2. **Independence Assumptions**
- Runs should be independent (different seeds)
- System conditions should be controlled
- Compiler/hardware consistency across runs

### 3. **Interpretation Cautions**
- Confidence intervals don't guarantee future performance
- Statistical significance ≠ practical significance
- Multiple testing corrections may be needed

## Future Extensions

- Prior knowledge incorporation
- Hierarchical models for function families
- Uncertainty quantification over model parameters

### 2. **Multi-Objective Optimization**
- Trade-offs between success rate and performance
- Pareto frontier analysis
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics

### 3. **Online Learning**
- Adaptive sampling based on uncertainty
- Sequential experimentation
- Dynamic confidence interval updates
