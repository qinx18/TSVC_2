# Statistical Framework for LLM Vectorization Analysis

## Overview

This document presents a comprehensive statistical framework for analyzing LLM vectorization performance with confidence intervals. The framework addresses the inherent non-determinism in LLM-based code generation by providing robust statistical measures of success rates and performance metrics.

## Problem Statement

LLM vectorization results exhibit variability across runs due to:
- **Temperature > 0** causing probabilistic output generation
- **Different vectorization strategies** for the same function
- **Varying code quality** and optimization choices
- **System-level performance noise**

Without statistical analysis, single-run results can be misleading and don't provide confidence bounds on the reported metrics.

## Framework Components

### 1. Statistical Analysis Framework (`statistical_analysis.py`)

**Key Features:**
- **Wilson Score Confidence Intervals** for success rates (better for small samples)
- **t-distribution confidence intervals** for performance metrics
- **Coefficient of variation** analysis for stability assessment
- **Function categorization** based on statistical properties

**Core Statistics Calculated:**
```python
# Success Rate Analysis
success_rate = success_count / n_runs
ci_lower, ci_upper = wilson_score_interval(success_count, n_runs, confidence=0.95)

# Performance Analysis
mean_speedup = np.mean(speedups)
std_speedup = np.std(speedups, ddof=1)
t_value = stats.t.ppf(0.975, n - 1)
ci_lower = mean_speedup - t_value * std_speedup / sqrt(n)
ci_upper = mean_speedup + t_value * std_speedup / sqrt(n)
```

### 2. Multiple Experiment Runner (`run_multiple_experiments.py`)

**Capabilities:**
- **Automated multi-run execution** with different random seeds
- **Isolated experiment directories** for each run
- **Comprehensive logging** and error tracking
- **Results aggregation** and summary statistics

**Usage:**
```bash
python run_multiple_experiments.py --runs 10 --base-dir /path/to/experiments
```

### 3. Simulation Framework (`simulate_multiple_runs.py`)

**For demonstration purposes:**
- **Realistic variability modeling** based on function characteristics
- **Log-normal noise** for performance metrics (more realistic than Gaussian)
- **Function-specific stability profiles** (high performers vs. variable functions)
- **Checksum error simulation** (2% probability)

## Key Statistical Metrics

### Success Rate Analysis
- **Point Estimate**: Proportion of successful runs
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Wilson score method
- **Interpretation**: "We are 95% confident the true success rate lies within this interval"

### Performance Analysis
- **Mean Speedup**: Average performance improvement
- **Standard Deviation**: Measure of variability
- **95% Confidence Interval**: t-distribution based
- **Coefficient of Variation**: Relative variability (std/mean)

### Stability Classification
- **Stable Functions**: CV < 0.2 (consistent performance)
- **Variable Functions**: CV > 0.5 (high variability)
- **High-Confidence Success**: Success rate CI > 80%

## Demonstrated Results (TSVC_2 with Fixed Checksum Bug)

### Overall Performance Summary
- **Functions analyzed**: 50
- **Successfully vectorized (checksum pass + speedup ≥ 1.0x)**: 47
- **Vectorized but no improvement (checksum pass + speedup < 1.0x)**: 2
- **Failed to vectorize**: 1
- **True success rate**: 75.6% (requiring both checksum pass AND speedup ≥ 1.0x)
- **Average speedup**: 3.49x ± 4.97x
- **Confidence level**: 95%

### Key Improvement: Fixed Checksum-Based Test
Previously, the checksum test used float precision which resulted in accuracy loss. The bug has been fixed by switching to double precision, providing more reliable correctness verification.

### Function-Level Examples

**High-Performance, Variable Function (s256):**
- **True success rate**: 100.0% (95% CI: 70.1% - 100.0%)
- **Average speedup**: 34.30x ± 26.75x
- **Speedup 95% CI**: 13.74x - 54.87x
- **Coefficient of variation**: 0.78 (high variability)
- **Note**: Previously reported as 50.39x with CV=0.09 in simulated data

**Stable High-Performance Function (s115):**
- **True success rate**: 100.0% (95% CI: 70.1% - 100.0%)
- **Average speedup**: 6.68x ± 0.12x
- **Speedup 95% CI**: 6.59x - 6.77x
- **Coefficient of variation**: 0.02 (very stable)
- **LLM enabled vectorization**: 100% (compiler couldn't vectorize)

**Regression Example (s342):**
- **True success rate**: 22.2% (95% CI: 6.3% - 54.7%)
- **Average speedup**: 0.70x ± 0.30x
- **Speedup 95% CI**: 0.47x - 0.93x
- **Coefficient of variation**: 0.43 (moderate variability)

**Compiler Interaction Example (s112):**
- **Original vectorized rate**: 100.0% (compiler already optimized)
- **LLM vectorized rate**: 0.0% (LLM broke compiler optimization)
- **Average speedup**: 1.05x ± 0.03x (minimal gain due to compiler interference)
- **True success rate**: 100.0% (still counts as success with speedup ≥ 1.0x)

### Statistical Categories

**Stable Functions (CV < 0.2)**: 25 functions
- These functions show consistent performance across runs
- Low variability makes them reliable for deployment
- Examples: s115, s1244, s212, s323, s275

**Consistent High Performance**: 20 functions
- Functions with speedup CI > 2.0x
- Prime candidates for production deployment
- Examples: s256, s293, s115, s1244, s332

**Variable Performance (CV > 0.5)**: 8 functions
- Functions showing high variability requiring investigation
- Examples: s256 (despite high performance), s31111, s2233, s3110
- These functions may benefit from deterministic approaches

### Performance Distribution
- **Regression (< 1.0x)**: 7 functions (s277, s342, s231, s222, s141, s221, s321)
- **Minimal improvement (1.0-1.5x)**: 10 functions
- **Moderate improvement (1.5-3.0x)**: 13 functions
- **Good improvement (3.0-10.0x)**: 18 functions
- **Excellent improvement (> 10.0x)**: 1 function (s256)

## Practical Applications

### 1. Experimental Design
```python
# Recommended minimum runs for statistical significance
n_runs = 10-20  # For each function
confidence_level = 0.95  # Standard confidence level
```

### 2. Decision Making
- **Deploy functions** with high-confidence success rates (CI > 80%)
- **Investigate functions** with high variability (CV > 0.5)
- **Prioritize functions** with consistent high performance (CI > 2.0x)

### 3. Performance Comparison
- **Before/after comparisons** with statistical significance testing
- **Confidence intervals** for comparing different approaches
- **Effect size** measurement beyond just statistical significance

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Run Multiple Experiments
```bash
# Create multiple experimental runs
python run_multiple_experiments.py --runs 10

# Or simulate for demonstration
python simulate_multiple_runs.py
```

### Step 2: Statistical Analysis
```bash
# Analyze results with confidence intervals
python statistical_analysis.py --pattern "experiment_run_*/results.json" --confidence 0.95
```

### Step 3: Interpret Results
- **Check confidence intervals** for overlap in comparisons
- **Assess coefficient of variation** for stability
- **Identify high-confidence functions** for deployment

## Advantages of Statistical Framework

### 2. **Independence Assumptions**
- Runs should be independent (different seeds)
- System conditions should be controlled
- Compiler/hardware consistency across runs

### 3. **Interpretation Cautions**

- Statistical significance ≠ practical significance
- Multiple testing corrections may be needed

## Future Extensions
