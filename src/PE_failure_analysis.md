## Complete Failure Analysis

### Failed Functions (5 total)

#### 1. s2111 - Wavefront Pattern with Data Dependencies

**Original Code**: 2D wavefront computation `aa[j][i] = (aa[j][i-1] + aa[j-1][i])/1.9`

**Failure Pattern**:
- Attempt 1: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 4.89e+04)
- Attempt 2: Not vectorized (LLM failed to use intrinsics)
- Attempt 3: Compilation error (missing variable declarations)

**Root Cause**: Complex data dependency pattern where each element depends on left and top neighbors, requiring sophisticated dependency analysis that the current prompt methodology cannot handle.

**Challenge**: Requires algorithmic restructuring or specialized wavefront vectorization techniques.

#### 2. s233 - Complex Memory Access Pattern

**Failure Pattern**:
- Attempt 1: Timeout (execution exceeded 30 seconds)
- Attempt 2: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 2.83e+05)
- Attempt 3: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 2.83e+05)

**Root Cause**: Involves complex memory access patterns that create either infinite loops or severe correctness issues.

**Challenge**: Execution timeout suggests infinite loop or extremely inefficient vectorization; large checksum differences indicate fundamental algorithmic errors.

#### 3. s242 - Persistent Correctness Issues

**Failure Pattern**:
- Attempt 1: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 1.28e+02)
- Attempt 2: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 1.28e+02)
- Attempt 3: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 1.28e+02)

**Root Cause**: Consistent correctness failures across all attempts suggest fundamental misunderstanding of the algorithm or persistent implementation error.

**Challenge**: Requires deeper analysis of the computation pattern and better validation methodology.

#### 4. s244 - Mixed Implementation Issues

**Failure Pattern**:
- Attempt 1: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 3.12e-02)
- Attempt 2: Not vectorized (LLM failed to use intrinsics)
- Attempt 3: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 3.12e-02)

**Root Cause**: Combination of understanding and implementation issues, with small but persistent correctness errors.

**Challenge**: Requires better task understanding and more robust implementation guidance.

#### 5. s451 - Understanding Failures

**Failure Pattern**:
- Attempt 1: Not vectorized (LLM failed to produce vectorized code)
- Attempt 2: Not vectorized (LLM failed to produce vectorized code)
- Attempt 3: Correctness failure (checksum diff: 6.35e-01)

**Root Cause**: LLM consistently failed to understand vectorization requirements, with final attempt showing implementation errors.

**Challenge**: Requires better task understanding and implementation guidance.

## Conclusion

The vectorizer-PE experiment achieved a 90% success rate but revealed significant challenges:

- **38% of functions** had poor performance (≤1.5x speedup)
- **Data dependencies and control flow** are the primary obstacles
- **Vectorization overhead** often dominates for simple computations
- **Correctness validation** needs significant improvement

The analysis reveals that while the current approach works for straightforward cases, it struggles with:

1. **Complex dependency patterns** (wavefront, sequential dependencies)
2. **Correctness validation** (persistent errors across attempts)
3. **Performance prediction** (many counterproductive vectorizations)
4. **Control flow handling** (conditional operations, early exits)

Future improvements should focus on:

1. **Pattern-specific guidance** for different dependency types
2. **Enhanced validation protocols** to ensure correctness
3. **Performance prediction** to avoid poor vectorization
4. **Systematic error recovery** for iterative improvement
