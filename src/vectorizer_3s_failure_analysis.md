## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Category 1: Complete Failures (8 functions)

#### 1.1 Self-Modifying Loops (High Priority)
**Functions**: s1113, s244
**Pattern**: Source array elements are overwritten during computation
**Example**: `a[i] = a[i] + a[i+1]` where `a[i]` is both source and destination

**Failure Mode**: Prompt engineering attempts vectorization without proper dependency analysis
**Root Cause**: Generic 6-step process doesn't identify self-modification hazards

**Prompt Engineering Gap**: Missing specific guidance for:
- Detecting when source elements get overwritten
- Implementing proper buffering strategies
- Recognizing when vectorization breaks semantics

#### 1.2 Complex Inter-Statement Dependencies (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s242, s318
**Pattern**: Multiple statements with complex data flow
**Example**: Accumulation patterns with index tracking

**Failure Mode**: Correctness errors due to incorrect dependency handling
**Root Cause**: Prompt assumes simple loop-carried dependencies

**Prompt Engineering Gap**: Needs:
- Multi-statement dependency analysis
- Guidance for maintaining loop-carried state
- Pattern recognition for accumulation operations

#### 1.3 Compilation Errors (Low Priority)
**Functions**: s343, s332
**Pattern**: Syntax errors in generated code
**Example**: Incorrect variable declarations, missing headers

**Failure Mode**: Generated code doesn't compile
**Root Cause**: Prompt doesn't emphasize code correctness checking

### Category 2: Performance Regressions (10 functions)

#### 2.1 Sequential Index Operations (High Priority)
**Functions**: s342 (0.48x), s141 (0.55x)
**Pattern**: Operations requiring sequential index tracking
**Example**: Conditional compaction, packed array operations

**Why Vectorization Fails**: SIMD can't efficiently handle sequential dependencies
**Current Prompt Issue**: Attempts vectorization without cost-benefit analysis

**Needed Improvement**: 
- Cost-benefit analysis step
- Recognition of anti-vectorization patterns
- Fallback to scalar when appropriate

#### 2.2 Conditional Operations (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s277 (0.57x), s161 (0.76x)
**Pattern**: Loops with significant conditional branches
**Example**: `if (condition) a[i] = b[i]`

**Why Vectorization Hurts**: Branch divergence and mask operations overhead
**Current Prompt Issue**: Doesn't consider branch overhead

#### 2.3 Memory Access Patterns (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s281 (0.79x), s321 (0.84x)
**Pattern**: Non-contiguous or complex memory access
**Example**: Indirect indexing, strided access

**Why Vectorization Fails**: Memory bandwidth limitations, cache misses
**Current Prompt Issue**: Doesn't analyze memory access efficiency

### Category 3: Minimal Improvements (12 functions)

#### 3.1 Simple Loops with Dependencies (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s3112 (1.01x), s3110 (1.18x), s211 (1.20x)
**Pattern**: Simple loops with mild dependencies
**Example**: `a[i] = a[i-1] + b[i]`

**Why Limited Improvement**: Vectorization overhead outweighs benefits
**Current Prompt Issue**: Doesn't recognize when scalar is better

#### 3.2 Already Optimized Loops (Low Priority)
**Functions**: s222 (0.84x), s322 (0.93x)
**Pattern**: Loops already well-optimized by compiler
**Example**: Simple arithmetic operations

**Why Limited Improvement**: Compiler auto-vectorization already effective
**Current Prompt Issue**: Doesn't detect existing optimizations

## Error Pattern Analysis

### By Error Type:
1. **Correctness Errors** (12 attempts): Dependency mishandling
2. **Not Vectorized** (5 attempts): Recognition of non-vectorizable patterns
3. **Execution Incomplete** (5 attempts): Infinite loops, timeouts
4. **Compilation Errors** (2 attempts): Syntax issues

### By Complexity:
- **Simple Loops**: 85% success rate
- **Loops with Dependencies**: 60% success rate
- **Self-Modifying Loops**: 25% success rate
- **Multi-Statement Loops**: 40% success rate

## Specific Prompt Engineering Recommendations

### 1. Enhanced Dependency Analysis (Critical)
**Current Step 4**: "Load original values(not updated if executing sequentially"
**Improved Version**: 
```
Step 4: Comprehensive Dependency Analysis
- Identify all read-after-write dependencies
- Detect self-modifying patterns (source == destination)
- Analyze cross-iteration dependencies
- Check for loop-carried state variables
- Flag hazardous patterns that break vectorization semantics
```

### 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis (Critical)
**New Step**: Insert between current steps 5 and 6
```
Step 5.5: Vectorization Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Estimate vectorization overhead (setup, cleanup, masking)
- Consider memory access patterns (contiguous vs. strided)
- Evaluate branch divergence costs
- Compare against scalar performance
- Flag cases where scalar may be better
```

### 3. Pattern Classification (High Priority)
**New Initial Step**:
```
Step 0: Pattern Classification
- Identify loop type: simple arithmetic, reduction, scan, compaction
- Detect anti-patterns: self-modification, complex dependencies
- Classify memory access: contiguous, strided, indirect
- Estimate vectorization potential: high, medium, low, avoid
```

### 4. Fallback Strategies (Medium Priority)
**Enhanced Step 6**:
```
Step 6: Adaptive Code Generation
- For high-potential patterns: full vectorization
- For medium-potential: hybrid scalar/vector approach
- For low-potential: optimized scalar with compiler hints
- For avoid patterns: minimal changes, rely on compiler
```

### 5. Correctness Verification (Medium Priority)
**New Final Step**:
```
Step 7: Correctness Verification
- Trace through first few iterations manually
- Verify dependency preservation
- Check boundary conditions
- Validate memory access patterns
```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate): Address Critical Failures
1. Enhanced dependency analysis for self-modifying loops
2. Cost-benefit analysis to avoid performance regressions
3. Pattern classification for common anti-patterns

### Phase 2 (Medium-term): Improve Marginal Cases
1. Hybrid vectorization strategies
2. Better handling of conditional operations
3. Memory access pattern optimization

### Phase 3 (Long-term): Refinement
1. Function-specific optimization strategies
2. Advanced pattern recognition
3. Performance prediction models

## Expected Impact

With these improvements, projected outcomes:
- **Failure rate**: 16% → 8% (reduce by half)
- **Performance regressions**: 20% → 10% (eliminate major regressions)
- **Average speedup**: Increase by 15-20% through better pattern selection

## Conclusion

The current prompt engineering approach succeeds for simple patterns but fails on complex dependencies and sequential operations. The recommended enhancements focus on better pattern recognition, cost-benefit analysis, and adaptive strategies to handle the full spectrum of vectorization challenges in the TSVC benchmark.
