## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Persistent Failures (Failed in Both Experiments)

#### s2111 - Wavefront Pattern with Data Dependencies

**Original Code**: 2D wavefront computation `aa[j][i] = (aa[j][i-1] + aa[j-1][i])/1.9`

**Baseline Failures**: not_vectorized, execution_incomplete, correctness
**PE-Enhanced Failures**: correctness, not_vectorized, compilation

**LLM Understanding Gap**: The complex data dependency pattern where each element depends on left and top neighbors requires sophisticated dependency analysis that both baseline and PE approaches failed to handle. The LLM cannot conceptualize the wavefront computation pattern.

**Challenge**: Requires algorithmic restructuring or specialized wavefront vectorization techniques.

#### s233 - Complex Memory Access Pattern

**Baseline Failures**: correctness, not_vectorized
**PE-Enhanced Failures**: timeout, correctness (checksum diff: 2.83e+05)

**LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM fails to understand the complex memory access patterns, with PE actually making it worse by introducing timeouts. The large checksum differences indicate fundamental algorithmic misunderstanding.

**Challenge**: Complex memory access patterns create either infinite loops or severe correctness issues.

#### s242 - Persistent Correctness Issues

**Baseline Result**: Failed (2.79x speedup but failed)
**PE-Enhanced Result**: Failed (2.47x speedup but failed)

**LLM Understanding Gap**: Consistent correctness failures (checksum diff: 1.28e+02) across all attempts in both experiments suggest fundamental misunderstanding of the algorithm. The LLM can generate code that compiles and runs but produces wrong results.

**Challenge**: Requires deeper analysis of the computation pattern and better validation methodology.

#### s244 - Mixed Implementation Issues

**Baseline Result**: Failed (1.19x speedup but failed)
**PE-Enhanced Result**: Failed (3.78x speedup but failed)

**LLM Understanding Gap**: Both approaches show correctness failures, with PE showing slight improvement in speedup but still failing. The LLM struggles with the combination of understanding and implementation issues.

**Challenge**: Small but persistent correctness errors (checksum diff: 3.12e-02) indicate subtle bugs.

### Regressions (Successful → Failed)

#### s451 - Understanding Failures

**Baseline Result**: Successful (1.04x speedup)
**PE-Enhanced Result**: Failed (not_vectorized, correctness errors)

**LLM Understanding Gap**: This is a critical regression where PE actually made the LLM worse at understanding the vectorization requirements. The more complex PE prompts confused the LLM about basic vectorization tasks.

**Root Cause**: PE over-complexity led to task confusion in simple cases.

### Poor Performance Analysis

#### Severe Performance Degradation (≤0.7x speedup)

**s342 (0.38x)**: Conditional packing/unpacking
- **Original**: `if (a[i] > 0.) { j++; a[i] = b[j]; }`
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM fails to recognize that conditional packing with data-dependent control flow cannot be efficiently vectorized
- **Issue**: Vectorization overhead dominates due to complex masking and gather operations

**s161 (0.60x)**: Sequential dependency with conditional updates
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM cannot properly analyze data dependencies and continues to vectorize when it shouldn't
- **Issue**: Cannot effectively vectorize due to data dependencies

**s2251 (0.62x)**: Gather/scatter heavy operations
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM doesn't understand the cost of irregular memory access patterns
- **Issue**: Irregular memory access patterns create significant overhead

**s281 (0.64x)**: Complex data dependencies
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM fails to analyze computation density vs. vectorization cost
- **Issue**: Vectorization overhead exceeds computation benefit

#### Moderate Performance Degradation (0.7x-1.0x)

**s116 (0.72x)**: Linear dependence with stride-5 pattern
- **Original**: `a[i] = a[i+1] * a[i]; a[i+1] = a[i+2] * a[i+1]; ...`
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM cannot handle irregular stride patterns effectively
- **Issue**: Irregular stride pattern prevents efficient vectorization

**s141 (0.73x)**: Sequential dependencies
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM fails to recognize when dependencies cannot be broken
- **Issue**: Cannot break data dependencies effectively

**s277 (0.80x)**: Gather/scatter operations
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM doesn't understand memory access overhead
- **Issue**: Memory access overhead dominates computation

### Minimal Improvement Cases (1.0x-1.5x speedup)

#### Understanding Gaps in Simple Cases

**s3112 (1.01x)**: Minimal computation benefit
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM applies vectorization to cases where overhead dominates
- **Issue**: Simple operations where vectorization setup cost is significant

**s258 (1.02x)**: Small computation kernel
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM cannot assess computation density properly
- **Issue**: Vectorization overhead nearly cancels benefits

**s123 (1.05x)**: Limited parallelism
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM doesn't recognize limited parallelism opportunities
- **Issue**: Algorithm structure limits vectorization benefits

**s114 (1.07x)**: Triangular matrix operations
- **LLM Understanding Gap**: The LLM struggles with gather overhead in triangular operations
- **Issue**: Triangular access patterns require expensive gather operations

## Root Cause Analysis
