## Detailed Failure Analysis

### Category 1: Complete Failures (8 functions)

#### 1.1 Complex Dependency Patterns (High Priority)
**Functions**: s1113, s244, s3112
**Pattern**: Self-modifying loops with read-after-write dependencies
**Example**: s1113 with `a[i] = (a[i+1] + b[i]) * c[i]` creating forward dependencies

**Failure Analysis**:
- s1113: Failed across 3 iterations with correctness errors (checksum diff: 6.4e+09 → 5.1e+08)
- Multiple vectorization attempts incorrectly handled dependency chains
- LLM struggled to identify the need for phase-based processing

**Root Cause**: Insufficient dependency analysis in full function approach
**Recommendation**: Enhance prompt with specific dependency detection patterns

#### 1.2 Accumulation and Reduction Operations (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s242, s332, s2111
**Pattern**: Complex accumulation patterns with multiple variables
**Example**: s242 with scalar-struct parameter passing and accumulation logic

**Failure Analysis**:
- s242: Compilation and execution issues across iterations
- s332: Persistent compilation errors with AVX2 intrinsics
- s2111: Execution incomplete errors

**Root Cause**: Complex parameter passing and reduction patterns not properly handled
**Recommendation**: Add specific guidance for reduction operations and parameter extraction

#### 1.3 Memory Access Pattern Issues (Medium Priority)  
**Functions**: s126, s116
**Pattern**: Complex memory access patterns or stride issues
**Example**: s126 with specific memory layout requirements

**Failure Analysis**:
- s126: Multiple correctness failures (checksum diff: 1.6e+09)
- s116: Execution incomplete across all attempts

**Root Cause**: Inadequate handling of complex memory access patterns
**Recommendation**: Improve memory access pattern analysis in prompts

### Category 2: Performance Regressions (12 functions)

#### 2.1 Over-Vectorization Issues (High Priority)
**Functions**: s451 (0.22x), s277 (0.53x), s281 (0.64x)
**Pattern**: Successful vectorization but with significant performance loss

**Analysis**:
- s451: Severely degraded performance despite correctness
- s277: Required 2 iterations, ended with 0.53x speedup
- Vector overhead exceeding sequential performance benefits

**Root Cause**: Inappropriate vectorization of inherently sequential operations
**Recommendation**: Add performance regression detection and fallback strategies

#### 2.2 Suboptimal Vectorization (Medium Priority)
**Functions**: s2251 (0.72x), s342 (0.76x), s318 (0.77x)
**Pattern**: Moderate performance regression

**Analysis**:
- s318: Successful after argument parameter fix, but poor performance
- Vectorization successful but not optimally implemented
- May indicate inefficient vector instruction usage

**Root Cause**: Suboptimal vector instruction selection or data layout
**Recommendation**: Enhance prompts with performance optimization guidance

### Category 3: Multi-Iteration Recovery Success (9 functions)

#### 3.1 Successful Recovery Patterns
**Functions**: s1213, s222, s2233, s232, s277, s31111, s321, s322, s451
**Pattern**: Failed initially but succeeded in later iterations

**Success Analysis**:
- s2233: Failed compilation → succeeded with 10.10x speedup
- s222: Correctness issues → recovered with 1.20x speedup
- s232: Not vectorized → recovered with 1.39x speedup

**Insights**: 
- Iterative feedback mechanism is effective

## Error Pattern Analysis

### Primary Error Types by Frequency
1. **Correctness (15 occurrences)**: Checksum mismatches, dependency handling errors
2. **Not Vectorized (5 occurrences)**: Failed to properly use AVX2 intrinsics  
3. **Execution Incomplete (3 occurrences)**: Runtime crashes or infinite loops
4. **Compilation (1 occurrence)**: Syntax errors with intrinsics

### Common Failure Patterns
1. **Dependency Mishandling**: Incorrect assumption about data independence
2. **Vector Boundary Issues**: Improper handling of array bounds in vectorized loops

3. **Dependency Analysis**: Need for more sophisticated dependency detection across full functions

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Enhanced Dependency Analysis**: Add specific prompts for detecting and handling complex dependencies
2. **Performance Regression Detection**: Implement checks to prevent obvious performance degradations
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Improve feedback mechanism for multi-iteration recovery

### Medium Priority
1. **Memory Pattern Recognition**: Better guidance for complex memory access patterns
2. **Reduction Operation Handling**: Specialized approaches for accumulation and reduction patterns
3. **Parameter Extraction**: Improved handling of function arguments and initialization

### Low Priority
1. **Error Recovery**: Better recovery strategies for compilation and runtime errors
2. **Performance Tuning**: Fine-tuning vector instruction selection
3. **Boundary Optimization**: Improved handling of non-vector-aligned operations

## Conclusion

The updated vectorizer with full function context demonstrates strong performance with 84% success rate and 5.76x average speedup. The approach successfully resolved previous issues like parameter passing while maintaining high optimization capabilities. Primary improvement areas focus on dependency analysis and performance regression prevention, with the iterative feedback mechanism proving effective for error recovery.

The transition from loop-only to full-function vectorization shows promise, with specific functions like s318 benefiting significantly from complete context awareness. Future development should focus on enhanced dependency analysis and performance regression detection to address the remaining 16% of failed functions.
