# TSVC Vectorizer Failure Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the results of the improved TSVC vectorizer experiment conducted on July 14, 2025, after fixing the test harness bug and implementing full function context. The experiment tested 50 TSVC functions with an overall success rate of **78.0% (39/50)** and average speedup of **3.56x**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Test Harness Bug Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The `initialise_arrays()` function in `common.c` lacked initialization for 7 functions (s1113, s1161, s1213, s1244, s2233, s2251, s31111)
- **Impact**: Arrays weren't reset between original and vectorized function runs, causing vectorized functions to start with accumulated values
- **Resolution**: Added proper initialization for all 7 functions in `initialise_arrays()`

### 2. Improved Vectorization Strategy
- **Full Function Context**: Modified prompt generation to send complete function implementations instead of extracted loops
- **Better Understanding**: LLM received complete context including variable declarations, dependencies, and function structure
- **Result**: Significant improvement in vectorization quality and success rate

4. **s231**: 8.28x - 2D array operations
5. **s275**: 7.88x - Matrix computation
6. **s115**: 7.08x - Array processing
7. **s291**: 6.63x - Simple loops with good vectorization potential

### Performance Regressions (<1.0x speedup)
1. **s451**: 0.21x - Severe regression due to over-vectorization
2. **s342**: 0.54x - Suboptimal vectorization strategy
3. **s2251**: 0.61x - Vector overhead exceeds benefits
4. **s161**: 0.72x - Complex dependency handling issues
5. **s232**: 0.83x - Inefficient vectorization pattern

### Failed Functions (11 total)
| Function | Final Error | Attempts | Key Issue |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| s1244 | correctness | 3 | Checksum mismatch across all attempts |
| s126 | correctness | 3 | Complex memory access patterns |
| s141 | not_vectorized | 3 | Inherently sequential operations |
| s2111 | not_vectorized | 3 | Failed to identify vectorization opportunities |
| s212 | correctness | 3 | Accumulation pattern errors |
| s2233 | correctness | 3 | 2D array dependency issues |
| s233 | correctness | 3 | Matrix operation correctness |

| s244 | correctness | 3 | Conditional logic errors |
| s256 | correctness | 3 | Checksum difference (3.3e+04) |
| s332 | execution_incomplete | 3 | Runtime execution issues |

### Error Pattern Distribution
- **Correctness errors**: 24 occurrences (most common)
- **Not vectorized**: 4 occurrences  
- **Execution incomplete**: 4 occurrences
- **Compilation errors**: 1 occurrence

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Correctness Issues (Primary Challenge)
- **Accumulation Patterns**: Functions like s242, s244 with complex accumulation logic
- **Dependency Handling**: Improper handling of loop-carried dependencies
- **Memory Access**: Complex memory patterns in s126, s256
- **Conditional Logic**: Vectorizing conditional operations in s244

### 2. Vectorization Limitations
- **Sequential Nature**: s141, s2111 contain inherently sequential operations
- **Complex Dependencies**: Some functions have dependencies that resist vectorization
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Certain algorithms don't benefit from vectorization

### 3. Performance Regressions
- **Over-Vectorization**: s451 shows severe performance penalty from unnecessary vectorization
- **Vector Overhead**: Cases where vectorization overhead exceeds computational benefits
- **Suboptimal Strategies**: Poor vectorization approaches that hurt performance

## Multi-Iteration Recovery Analysis

### Successful Recovery Patterns
Functions that succeeded after initial failures:
- **s232**: compilation error → correctness error → success (2.32x speedup)
- **s277**: correctness error → success (3.92x speedup)
- **s321**: correctness error → success (1.56x speedup)
- **s322**: correctness error → success (1.15x speedup)
- **s451**: correctness error → success (0.21x speedup, but wrong direction)

### Recovery Strategies
1. **Compilation Error Recovery**: Usually successful in subsequent attempts
2. **Correctness Error Recovery**: Mixed results, depends on complexity
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple attempts help identify and fix issues

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Improvements
- **Enhanced Correctness Validation**: Develop better validation for complex accumulation patterns
- **Dependency Analysis**: Improve LLM's understanding of loop-carried dependencies
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Add safeguards against over-vectorization

### 2. Medium-term Enhancements
- **Selective Vectorization**: Identify functions that shouldn't be vectorized
- **Pattern Recognition**: Develop better recognition of vectorization-friendly patterns
- **Performance Prediction**: Predict likely speedup before attempting vectorization

### 3. Long-term Strategy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine LLM vectorization with traditional compiler techniques
- **Specialized Handling**: Develop specialized approaches for different algorithm classes
- **Continuous Learning**: Use failure patterns to improve future vectorization attempts

## Conclusion

The vectorizer experiment demonstrates significant progress with a 78% success rate and 3.56x average speedup. The test harness bug fix and full function context implementation were crucial improvements. However, correctness remains the primary challenge, particularly for functions with complex dependencies and accumulation patterns.

The 22% failure rate, while concerning, provides valuable insights into the limitations of LLM-based vectorization. Future work should focus on improving correctness validation, preventing performance regressions, and developing specialized handling for challenging algorithmic patterns.

**Key Success**: s1113 achieved 9.03x speedup after the test harness fix, validating the importance of proper testing infrastructure.

**Key Challenge**: Functions like s242 and s244 consistently fail across all attempts, indicating fundamental limitations in handling complex accumulation patterns.
